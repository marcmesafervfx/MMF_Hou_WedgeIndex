This is a basic tool that will allow you update the wedge index instantly. That way you'll be able to visualize the value of each of the wedges.

The installation for this tool is going to be pretty simple:
- Save the hda in your /Documents/houdiniX.X/"Custom Folder"/
- Go to assets tab inside your Houdini --> Install Asset Library
- Drop the path where you stored the hda inside of the Digital Asset Library parameter.
- Click Install.
Now, you'll be able to use it inside your out context
